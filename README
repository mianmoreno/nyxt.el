* nyxt.el
=nyxt.el= consists of custom logic to interact with [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/][Nyxt]] from Emacs. In contrast to [[https://github.com/ag91/emacs-with-nyxt][emacs-with-nyxt]], it doesn't bundle any Nyxt configuration and only includes a couple of interactive helpers for some common Nyxt operations. Users are encouraged to use the entry point function =nyxt-run= to build their own functionality.

This package requires the [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly][SLY]] Emacs package to interact with the underlying Nyxt Lisp image. If you're an [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] user, you'll also have the ability to make commands focus on the corresponding Nyxt window for a more seamless experience.

To install the package, simply point to the package in your =load-path=.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/nyxt.el")
#+end_src

The easiest way to contribute to this project is to use the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and start developing on the local checkout by invoking the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
cd /path/to/nyxt.el
guix shell --pure
#+end_src

An example configuration might look like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c y") 'nyxt-map)
(with-eval-after-load 'nyxt
  (setopt nyxt-path (executable-find "guix"))
  (setopt nyxt-startup-flags '("shell" "-D" "-f" "path/to/nyxt/build-scripts/nyxt.scm" "--" "path/to/nyxt/nyxt" "-e" "(start-slynk)")))
#+end_src

Above, we first set the default bindings included in the =nyxt-map= to the ~C-c y~ global binding. By default, this package will spawn a Nyxt process with the =-e (start-slynk)= flags so that it can launch and connect to a Slynk process. However, as shown above, you're free to modify the executable path and the flags supplied to it, such as if you're developing on Nyxt using the [[https://guix.gnu.org][GNU Guix]] package manager.
